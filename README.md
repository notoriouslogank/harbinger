# harbinger

A somewhat primitive discord bot for managing a Minecraft server (among other things).  harbinger is written primarily in Python, however some commands require a some shell commands via SSH to work.

**Note:**
At the time of this writing (v1.3.3), there is no comprehensive installer [Still true as of 1.6.4].  That's certainly on the roadmap (not yet implemented), but at this time all modules have been hand-picked, installed, and configured by me -- for better or for worse.

harbinger was written from the ground up to run on a Raspberry Pi.  While I've made some reasonable attempts to make this codebase platform agnostic, I can't promise it's going to run on your system if it's not explicitly stated herein.  However if you find it *does* work on a platform *not* listed here, don't hesitate to drop me an [issue](https://github.com/notoriouslogank/harbinger/issues).
